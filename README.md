# R-THAAAAAAï

> The mid ‘80s was a renaissance for shooters. In 1985, Konami released _Gradius_. Not long later, in 1987, Irem released _R-Type_. These are two of the most important games in the genre. It’s completely stunning that, in its relative infancy, Irem could shape a game as ingenious as _R-Type_. One of the premiere side-scrolling shooters, _R-Type_ moved a bit slower than your typical twitch games, with a meticulous pace and almost leisurely scrolling. The idea wasn’t to simply blast everything on the screen, although you could certainly try. The idea was, quite simply, to stay alive. Naturally, given the claustrophobic nature of the levels, swarming with enemies from every angle, this was never an easy task.

This game is informally called a Horizontal Shmup (e.g. Shoot’em’up), and while R-Type is not the first one of its category, this one has been a huge success amongst gamers in the 90’s, and had several ports, spin-offs, and 3D remakes on modern systems. Other similar and well known games are the Gradius series and Blazing Star on Neo Geo.
